              <strong>About the Owners:</strong> Tammy and I (Randy) have enjoyed traveling to Branson for decades and now we have a permanent place to entertain family and guests. My wife's specialty is "English as a Second Language" and I am an Intercultural Consultant (PhD Intercultural Studies). We are both amateur musicians and have lived in Central America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East.

              <strong>Why We Chose Branson:</strong> When we were looking for a place to buy in Branson we thought about the things that are important to us and that would be attractive to other guests. For us that meant centering our search around Table Rock Lake and near Silver Dollar City (we have been going there since we were dating as highschool sweethearts). The condos we purchased have spectacular lake views and you can walk down to the water's edge. Our final criteria was to go with something big enough to accommodate our entire family (we have two adult married children and seven grandchildren), so we went with the largest number of true bedrooms the condos offered, which was 4. Obviously Tammy and I can come stay in the master bedroom with its view of the lake by ourselves as well, which is what we hope honeymooners will consider.

              <strong>The Unique Benefits of these Condos:</strong> We have stayed in a variety of places in the Branson area. The last place we stayed in before we bought our own was cheap, but it was in a basement with no view except the hallway and we were very dissatisfied. Over the years our favorite places had balconies where you could look out over Table Rock Lake. Now, with our own condos, we actually have about twice the balcony space of any place we have ever stayed. What a wonderful way to greet the day - coffee in one hand and the Bible in the other.

            <p>After years of managing our condos remotely by ourselves, we opted to partner with RentBranson. RentBranson is actually there in Branson and has all the expertise to respond to our guests in an immediate manner.
