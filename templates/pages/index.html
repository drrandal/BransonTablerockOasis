    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
    <p>
    To provide you with high quality lodging that enhances your vacation time.
    </p>

    <h3>Your Vacation</h3>
    <p>
      Nestled in the Ozark Mountains, Branson Tablerock Oasis is your home-away-from-home. Come and enjoy the splendor of Table Rock Lake from your expansive balcony or get out on the water with a boat from nearby Indian Point Marina (indianpointmarina.com) or Rock Lane Marina. Boating, fishing, tubing, and swimming all await you if that is your desire. Championship golf courses, like the Paine Stewart Top-of-the-Rock course are nearby. Closer yet is Silver Dollar City, the family friendly attraction that helped launch Branson into one of the nation's top vacation destinations.
    </p>

    <h3>Oasis Condo</h3>
    <p>
      We invite you to experience our upscale condo as your very own retreat designed for large families, multiple couples, or a renewal time for just you and your spouse. Each of the 4 bedrooms, that’s right 4 bedrooms, (and 3 bathrooms) are tastefully decorated and updated with the most modern amenities. These are true bedrooms, not lofts or other semi-private rooms. The master suite includes not only its own private bath and a king-sized bed, but also a walkout to the balcony. The other three bedrooms have queen-sized beds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our condo is easy to get to and can be accessed by an elevator from the same level where you park your car. Thus, it is ideal for people with mobility issues who will be able to enjoy all of the main floor amenities (2 of the bedrooms / 2 of the bathrooms / kitchen / main floor living / dining / and balcony). So, bring your elderly parents and grandparents knowing they will have a wonderful experience!
    </p>
    <p>
      The condo also has two separate living areas so that different activities can occur simultaneously. The main floor living area has a queen sleeper sofa and boasts a large Smart TV. The upper floor living area has a section with a sleeper sofa (queen) and a large Smart TV, as well as an area with a game table. Each of the 4 bedrooms have their own Smart TVs, so everybody can be happy. Thus the 1700 sq. ft. condo can accommodate 12 people on beds, which includes the four traditional beds in the bedrooms and the two foldout sofas. (While we do our best to provide for your sleeping requirements, please note that sleeper sofas are typically not as supportive and comfortable as regular beds.)
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a fully-equipped galley style kitchen with a dishwasher / refrigerator with ice maker / microwave, and stove. Toaster, coffee maker (and grinder), can opener,  plates, silverware, pots and pans, and assorted cooking utensils are all provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our condo is located about mid-point on a ridge in the Ozark Mountain range. If you walk down the slope you will arrive at the Table Rock Lake water's edge where you can fish, kayak or take a refreshing swim.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you walk across across the slope you can swim in the seasonal outdoor pool - Memorial Day weekend to Labor Day weekend (free to guests).
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearby Indian Point Marina and Rock Lane Marina both offer boat rentals and rental slips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sit out on our spacious balcony and enjoy the sunrise with a cup of coffee or gather the family for steaks on the electric grill. No matter the season, the views are always awesome and the wildlife active.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is our sincere desire that you thoroughly enjoy your hard-earned time away from jobs and stress. We want your stay in our condo to be a relaxing oasis where the demands on your time melt away and are replaced by a renewed sense of wonder and appreciation for God's creation.
    </p>


    <h3>Location</h3>
    <p>
      Our condo is located in the Treehouse Condos community on Indian Point, Branson, Missouri - right on Table Rock Lake. This is a residential community that also allows nightly rentals. It is therefore more geared to a family environment and is definitely not a “party” site. We want to maintain good relations with our neighbors, so our guests are asked to respect those around them who may live here year-round.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are just over 1 mile past Silver Dollar City, so you can actually skip downtown Branson by entering from either the North or South route. Remember, our community not only has lake views, but is actually on the lake itself.
    </p>
    <p>
