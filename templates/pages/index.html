    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
    <p>
    To provide you with high quality lodging that enhances your vacation time.
    </p>

    <h3>Your Vacation</h3>
    <p>
      Nestled in the Ozark Mountains, Branson Tablerock Oasis is your home-away-from-home. Come and enjoy the splendor of Tablerock Lake from your expansive balcony or launch your boat from our covered slip, which is included in your rental. Boating, fishing, tubing, and swimming all await you if that is your desire. Championship golf courses, like the new Paine Stewart Top-of-the-Rock course are nearby. Closer yet is Silver Dollar City, the family friendly attraction that helped launch Branson into one of the nation's top vacation destinations.
    </p>

    <h3>Oasis Condo</h3>
    <p>
      We invite you to experience our upscale condo as your very own retreat designed for large families, multiple couples, or a renewal time for just you and your spouse. Each of the 3 bedrooms (and 3 bathrooms) are tastefully decorated and updated with the most modern amenities. These are true bedrooms, not lofts or other semi-private rooms. The master suite includes not only its own private bath and a king-sized bed, but also a walkout to the balcony. The other two bedrooms have queen-sized beds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The condo also has two separate living areas so that different activities can occur simultaneously. The main floor living area has a sleeper sofa, a queen, and boasts a 50" 1080p HD flatscreen TV (and Blu-ray player). The upper floor living area has a section with a sleeper sofa, a full, and a 42" 1080p HD flatscreen TV – and a section with a futon, a full, and game table. Also each of the 3 bedrooms have their own 40" 1080p HD flatscreen TVs, so everybody can be happy. Thus the 1664 sq. ft. condo can accommodate 12 people on beds, which includes the three traditional beds and the three foldout sofas/futon. (While we do our best to provide for your sleeping requirements, please note that sleeper sofas and futons are typically not as supportive and comfortable as regular beds.) The rental base rate is for the first 6 people, additional guests are $10/night/person.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a fully-equipped galley style kitchen with a new dishwasher / new refrigerator with ice maker / new microwave, and new stove. Toaster, coffee maker (and grinder), can opener,  plates, silverware, pots and pans, and assorted cooking utensils are all provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our condo is located about mid-point on a ridge in the Ozark Mountain range. If you walk down the slope you will arrive at Tablerock Lake’s water's edge by the boathouse where a slip awaits your boat; the slip is included with the rental. Have your own boat? There is a gravel parking lot where you can park your trailer after you launch - do this either next door or at Indian Point Marina.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you walk up the slope from the condo, you can swim in the seasonal outdoor pool - Memorial Day weekend to Labor Day weekend (free to guests). Or check out the year-round indoor hot tubs. There is also a fitness room for people age 18 and older. The hot tubs and fitness room are operated by Treehouse Condos and are available for a nominal $20 extra fee paid directly to the Treehouse office good for the entire family for the entire stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sit out on our spacious balcony and enjoy the sunrise with a cup of coffee or gather the family for steaks on the electric grill. No matter the season, the views are always awesome and the wildlife active.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is our sincere desire that you thoroughly enjoy your hard-earned time away from jobs and stress. We want your stay in our condo to be a relaxing oasis where the demands on your time melt away and are replaced by a renewed sense of wonder and appreciation for God's creation.
    </p>


    <h3>Location</h3>
    <p>

Remember, our community not only has lake views, but is actually on the lake itself.
